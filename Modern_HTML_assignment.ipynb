        "  - **Semantic HTML:** Using the correct HTML elements to structure content makes it easier for screen readers to understand and for users to navigate the page. For example, using <h1> for the main heading, <h2> for subheadings, <p> for paragraphs, and <ol> or <ul> for lists.\n",

This means that users can navigate using the tab key, activate buttons with the enter key, and use the up/down/left/right arrows to interact with elements.\n",
